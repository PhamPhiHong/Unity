License:  These rules are what I go by, for free graphics (non commercial use only) can be found on my DeviantArt account, RPG Maker web, or RPG Maker Central.  Please do not share these outside of these websites and please share my topic instead.  Thank you!

These are your rights with these graphics.

1.  You may only use these tilesets if you are using a legal copy of RPG Maker (I will not hunt down people who have illegal copies as I do not own or make money off of RPG Maker, so it is not my job).

2.  You must own a copy of RPG Maker VX or VX Ace as some of these tiles have bits of those tiles in the edits.  If you do own a copy of those makers, you are free to use my edits in whatever maker you desire, as long as it is legally owned.

3.  You may create whatever game you desire with these graphics from a child's game to hard core adult game (I don't see why you would, but you can).

4.  You may edit, but please do not share them, share the topic.  I don't mind if you give a piece, but you must give them a copy of this Read me when you do making it clear that you did not create said graphic.  

5.  You may use these graphics in free games, shareware games, commecial, donation, contest maps or use on kickstarter if you so desire without purchasing the rights to do so.  I will never charge money for edits, but I do have a patreon page that I am in the middle of planning to release really good edits for my graphics to raise money through donations. 

6.  You must credit me, as Caitlin Nicnubill and no, if you are wondering that is not my real name.  It is my pen name that I've been going under for some time.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask me any questions through RPGMakerweb.com (forums) or RPGMakerCentral.com, and my name is always Cait.  Or you might try my deviantart.com account and my name is Nicnubill there.  Note:  I will not join your team, as I am in the middle of creating my own game at the moment.
